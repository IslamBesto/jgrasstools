<p>Select a <i>hillslope</i> or some of its property from the <b>DEM</b>. Since hillslope
are identiﬁed by channel links, if a numbering of links is available, it gives to any pixel
draining into a given link the link number.</p>

<p> Eventually, one can select all the hillslope points which
share the same link number, i.e. the points which belongs to the same hillslope. Another use of this
application (see [1]) is to associate to any hillslope point its channel path length. In general, it labels
any hillslope pixel with the channel quantity found in the position where the hillslope pixel drains.
