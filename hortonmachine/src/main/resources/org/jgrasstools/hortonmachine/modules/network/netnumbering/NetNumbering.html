Assigns numbers to the network's links. 
<br>
It can be used by Hillslope2ChannelAttribute to label the hillslope flowing into the link with the same number.

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the drainage directions (obtained with Markoutlets, DrainDir, FlowDirections)</li>
<li>the file containing the total contributing areas (obtained
with DrainDir, Tca or Multitca)</li>
<li>the file containing the channel network (obtained with ExtractNetwork)</li>
<li>if we choose to split the network in a definite set of defined positions, the vector point map containing the monitoring points</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file with the net order according the Hack lengths</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
The Hack order corresponds (one to one) to the old Horton's network enumeration.

To run the model it is necessary that the outlet pixel presents a drainage direction value equal to 10. If there is not such identification, the program will not work correctly.
