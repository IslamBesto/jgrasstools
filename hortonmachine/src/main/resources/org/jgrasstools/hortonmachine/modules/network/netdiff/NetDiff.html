<p>Calculates the difference between the value of a quantity in one point and the value of the
same quantity in another point across a basin. 
</p>
<p>
The points in which calculating the difference are
individuated by an opportune matrix. Typically this matrix could contain the values of the Strahler
numbers of a net, i.e. the network pixels are labeled by the stream number and the same stream
contains a group of subsequent pixel. The points chosen for the calculation of the difference are
the ﬁrst and the last of any stream, i.e. those in which the numeration changes.
 </p>
<p>
If the matrix of the quantity to calculate is that of elevations, then, again in the case shown, netdiff calculates the elevation
difference along a Strahler branch. If instead of the ﬁle containing the Strahler numeration the matrix
of the magnitude is used, the variation of a quantity in a link is measured.
