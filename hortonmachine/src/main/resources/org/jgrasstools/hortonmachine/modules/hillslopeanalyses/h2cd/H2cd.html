<p>Calculates for each hillslope pixel its distance from the river networks, following the steepest
descent (i.e. the drainage directions). It can evaluate the distance in as a projection of the plan or the real distance (3d mode).

The program can work in three different ways: 
<ol>
<li> calculate the distance (projected on the plane)  from the outlet in pixel number (pMode = 0)
<li> calculate the distance (projected on the plane)  from the outlet in meters on the plane (pMode = 1)
<li> calculate the distance (in 3d) from the outlet in meters in 3d (pMode = 1 and the inPit map not null)
</ol>
