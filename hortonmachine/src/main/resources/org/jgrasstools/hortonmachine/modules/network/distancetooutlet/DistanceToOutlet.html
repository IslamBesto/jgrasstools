<p>Calculates the distance of each pixel
from the outlet, measured along the drainage directions. By aggregating the matrix so obtained, we
get the so called <i>width function</i>. It can evaluate the distance in as a projection of the plan or the real distance (3d mode).
</p>
<BR>
The program can work in three different ways: 
<ol>
<li> calculate the distance (projected on the plane)  from the outlet in pixel number (pMode = 0)
<li> calculate the distance (projected on the plane)  from the outlet in meters on the plane (pMode = 1)
<li> calculate the distance (in 3d) from the outlet in meters in 3d (pMode = 1 and the inPit map not null)
</ol>
