Subdivides the sites of a basin in 11 topographic classes, nine of which are deﬁned according to
[1].
<p> 
Such classes are the nine classes based (also in [2]) obtained with
TC ; the points belonging to the channel networks constitute a tenth class (derived from the use of
ExtractNetwork), the points with high slope (higher than a critical angle) the eleventh class.
